MH-Paikalliset
==============

MH-Paikalliset is a mobile local bus route guide / trip planner utilizing Matkahuolto's online trip planner services (for Android). 

**2015-09-08**: As development is practically discontinued, it's now available as open source!

> jsoup is included as source files (ok, still stupid, forgive my noobidity at the time) as some of the Matkahuolto APIs required uppercase XML while jsoup forcibly produced lowercased XML output. The included jsoup source files have all these lowercase conversions removed. CoordinateUtils has some of the KKJ zone changes.
